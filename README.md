## Tom Kellett

After several years working as a management consultant on technology implementation projects (mainly at banks, but some public sector work too), I decided to take the leap into software development and joined the Makers Academy bootcamp in September 2021. I enjoyed delivering value by being the interface between the business and the development teams I have worked with, but felt a longing to be able to be actually building the things people want and need to use, as well as teasing out the requirements for them.

Being able to build things to improve the way people interact with their world and do the things they need to do really excites me, and I am someone that likes to continually learn and test the limits of my abilities.
