## Tom Kellett

After several years working as a management consultant on technology implementation projects (mainly at banks, but some public sector work too), I decided to take the leap into software development and joined the Makers Academy bootcamp in September 2021. I enjoyed delivering value by being the interface between the business and the development teams I have worked with, but felt a longing to be able to be actually building the things people want and need to use, as well as teasing out the requirements for them.

Being able to build things to improve the way people interact with their world and do the things they need to do really excites me, and I am someone that likes to continually learn and test the limits of my abilities.

## Skills

**Communication** - Having worked as a management consultant on technical implementations, I have plenty of experience tailoring the delivery of a message to the relative technical knowledge of the audience. From senior business stakeholders who want to know the 'so what?' without being burdened with the technical detail, down to needing to communicate the minutae of processes to development teams.

**Empathy** - Without the ability to put myself in others' shoes, I wouldn't have been able to succeed as a consultant gathering requirements from business stakeholders and working in diverse teams. Most recently manifested in the Rising Star Award at BCS as evidence of my ability to perform at a high level.

**Resilience** - Working at the coal-face with sometimes difficult clients breeds a necessity for a thick skin and I pride myself on my ability to roll with the punches but most importantly take constructive criticism and adapt my ways of working to continually improve.

**Adaptability** - From being a client, to business analysis and product ownership at IBM and BCS Consulting, now to software development. My experience across the spectrum of technology projects has made me well-suited to drop into any project and be able to quickly
